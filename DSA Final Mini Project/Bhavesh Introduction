2)  My name is Bhavesh Suryawanshi.

3)  I'm from Shirpur, a small town in Maharashtra's northern region famed 
    for its water conservation and cleanliness, as well as being the intellectual hub 
	of the North Maharashtra University.
 
6)  I consider myself to be a confident, enthusiastic, optimistic, and hard working 
    guy because I went from being a skinny guy who was afraid of talking to strangers 
	to a well-known model who performed on major stages in Pune such as Sinhgad Karandak, 
	Piter England, etc
   
7)  My never give up attitude led me to the title of  Mr Karandak in the year 2018.
   
8)  since reading is my hobby, I used to travel locations in my thoughts while reading,
    As a result, I sought real-life exploration, so I began trekking.
   
9)  Cooking became a necessity, then a passion for me after spending 
    the majority of my life away from home.

4)  My educational background includes a bachelor's degree in engineering from Pune University.

10) After completion of this course, I want to be a part of an organisation where 
    I can contribute to its growth and that organisation should be capable of 
	providing me an oportunity to enhance my skills.
